***AMELIA'S VOICE***

Very simple right now, run the server, go to the localhost and port 5010 for main program, go to  /admin to create tiles
to access admin panel in main program hold the light grey button for a long time (too long for an autistic child!!!) and then a lock panel will appear with random numbered button in the corners
press in order to unlock and access admin panel where you can create pages and add tiles you created to them.
I am using elevenlabs voices for making tiles and that works really well.  My intention is to use .webp for all graphics and maybe .ogg for audio.

If you just want to use this right now today for your autistic child or whoever needs it just run the server on your computer and grab their tablet and direct to 
127.0.0.1:5010 in their browser or whatever works for your localhost 
It will auto fullscreen and rotate the Android tablet or phone and you can start using right now.

If you need help actually using it for real world use, contact me and I will help you.
