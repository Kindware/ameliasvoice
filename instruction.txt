Until proper systems are in place :

python3 -m venv venv
source /venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   ;)
python3 server.py

Navigate modern web browser to 127.0.0.1:5001 to use software

Navigate to 127.0.0.1:5001/admin to create tiles

In the main software press and hold the grey button in the bottom corner
for a long time (an autistic child will not be able to do this) 30 seconds
and then as a second layer of defense there is a four corner random number trigger
select buttons in order to access control panel

Within control panel you can create the page layouts and do most tasks

There is an auto return on every page so that inactivity will automatically return
you to the main menu after 30 seconds.

(There are a lot of 30 second timers, when developing I really reccomend dropping to 1 second!!!)
