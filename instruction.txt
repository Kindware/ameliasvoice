This is the foundation of a new AAC system

The program consists of multiple pages with tiles that represent words, tiles consist of an image and an audio file
The main page consists of some single words and some words that open new pages.
When the user presses a button the image scales to 150% and it plays the audio file, the image stays zoomed while the key is pressed and returns to normal when key is released.
On any sub page if there is no touch or activity for 30 seconds it returns to the main page.
We need a secret administration menu that the user can't access but the Parent / Guardian can.
In the administration menu we can import images and audio clips and use those to make new tiles for the screens,
we can then re arrange the tiles and move them to other screens, create new ones and add them to screens,
remove unwanted tiles from screen also.

There should be 24 evenly spaces tiles per page 6 tiles wide x 4 tiles deep

All linked pages tiles are : Zoom tile and play audio, stay zoomed until release, return to main page main page

Images are 512 x 512 pixel .webp files
Audio are all .ogg format

this web enabled program will be run on a wide variety of screens including phones and tablets so the pages
must be properly anchored and scale across any screen.

create a placeholder image and sound file for now but we need to make sure we are using simple obvious naming for our files and tiles

When you are done I should be able to go into the administration menu and import all my audio and video and eedit and create all the tile myself.
